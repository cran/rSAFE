\title{Calculating a Transformation of a Continuous Feature Using PDP/ALE Plot}
\usage{
safely_transform_continuous(
  explainer,
  variable,
  response_type = "ale",
  grid_points = 50,
  N = 200,
  penalty = "MBIC",
  nquantiles = 10,
  no_segments = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{explainer}{DALEX explainer created with explain() function}

\item{variable}{a feature for which the transformation function is to be computed}

\item{response_type}{character, type of response to be calculated, one of: "pdp", "ale".
If features are uncorrelated, one can use "pdp" type - otherwise "ale" is strongly recommended.}

\item{grid_points}{number of points on x-axis used for creating the PD/ALE plot, default 50}

\item{N}{number of observations from the dataset used for creating the PD/ALE plot, default 200}

\item{penalty}{penalty for introducing another changepoint,
one of "AIC", "BIC", "SIC", "MBIC", "Hannan-Quinn" or numeric non-negative value}

\item{nquantiles}{the number of quantiles used in integral approximation}

\item{no_segments}{numeric, a number of segments variable is to be divided into in case of founding no breakpoints}
}
\value{
list of information on the transformation of given variable
}
\description{
The safely_transform_continuous() function calculates a transformation function
for the continuous variable using a PD/ALE plot obtained from black box model.
